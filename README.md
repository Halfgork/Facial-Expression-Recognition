## ABSTRACT
In modern days,Communicating turned into the most and significant point in our lifes.One
of the most universal and fundamental approaches to understand each other is through facial
expressions.On the other hand in the last decade,Human to PC and PC to Human interaction become very fluent with the progress of deep learning and with FER technology.In this
project,I aimed to detect facial expressions with using multiple deep learning models and
implementing some datasets such as FER2013.In this project,I aimed to take advantage of
existing convolutional neural network which was pretrained for facial expression classification and make my own CNN with FER2013 dataset for WebAPP.Additionally, I am going to
show a mobile web app end of the presentation which runs my FER2013 models onÂ­device in real time
